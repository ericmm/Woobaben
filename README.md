Thoughts in my mind

Talk is cheap, show me the code.

---------------------
SimpeArrayMap - refactored and improved based on Mikhail Vorontsov's ObjObjMap, faster and less memory consumption than java.util.HashMap  --Done
Faster java object attribute accessors by utlilising sun.misc.Unsafe  --Done
Faster java heap object copy (clone) by sun.misc.Unsafe  --Done

Near plan
Heap object serialiser and deserialiser (JSON, Binary format, etc.)
Off-heap object facility
Off-heap object copy/serialise/deserialise

Future plan
Integration of Kilim (Java coroutine - lightweight thread)
JNI - use 'javacritical' optimisation with off-heap memory 
And some other more...
